<h2>Why?</h2>
<p style="width: 50%">This project was born from a desire to add more transparency to whatâ€™s actually happening with our
  teams and teammates at DataRobot. After March of this year (2022), many robots across the globe wanted more information
  about who had left the company and when.  All of this information is publicly available, but to my knowledge, it has not
  been compiled in one place - until now.
</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p style="width: 50%">All the information you see is pulled from a database that will be updated monthly.  It shows our
  colleagues who have left the company each month starting from January of 2022.  To be clear, it does not distinguish
  between robots who left the company voluntarily and those that were let go or dismissed.  It only shows when they
  stopped being our colleagues.
